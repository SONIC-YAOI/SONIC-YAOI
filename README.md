- See me sitting w/ my friends? Likely on vc w/ em, but ff to still sit w/ us :) just ask me first! especially if ur a friend they don't know abt :(
- VERY VERY ON AND OFF!!! I can be on pt everyday OR offline for over a month. If you do want to get closer, ask 4 my discord. First rule still applies, I don't initiate convos very often :(
- I can very easily swap fandoms and phases on some ocassions, if I stop showing up in a specific area thats prob cuz my main interest is elsewhere (me moving from marvel to mha. my marvel gh oomfs hey.)
- If you ever want to find me in a fandom area, I'm almost always by a tree! Tree spots r my comfort areas
